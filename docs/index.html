      <p>Over the last few years, the issue of mass shootings has become a major talking point. There are still a lot of these events that are happening all over the USA. A shooting is considered “a mass shooting” when there are at least more than 4 victims. The issue has been around for a very long time, and yet no radical measures have ever been taken for the reason that  the causes of these events still seem to be quite unclear. The USA is far from being the only country where mass shootings are happening, yet we chose it as a case study because it is home to more than one third of all the mass shooting cases between 1966 and 2012, thus a lot of research has already been done there. This project aims to find the causes of these homicides through data that has been collected on all the mass shootings committed by criminals in the US over the last 60 years. There are a great number of factors as to why these people perpetrate such heinous actions towards their fellow humans, for example: mental instability, bad education, and economic decline. Our goal is to categorize the shooters into groups based on the motives of their actions to find out if they all have a common reason for their actions. Finding the cause of an event is very often the first in finding a solution, which will be our next step. We will try to propose a solution to reduce or even eradicate mass shootings. Our goal is to ascertain whether the shooters had severe mental illnesses or trauma whether from childhood or adulthood that ultimately lead to the moment where they committed the mass shooting. We will try to assert if they can be used as warning signs, by analyzing the data of previous events and the mental state of the offenders.

      <h2><p style = "text-align: center">The Null Hypothseis and Alternate Hypothesis</p></h2>
      <p>As our hypothesis, we assumed that the number of mental illnesses and personal traumas a person suffers from does not affect their likelihood to commit mass shooting, and does not affect the number of people they are likely to kill. On the other hand, as an alternate hypothesis, we can assume that this number actually has an impact on the probability of someone becoming a mass shooter. Research over the years has shown that mass shootings are actually not directly related to severe mental illnesses. Psychiatrists such as Ragy Girgis, MD from Columbia University can confirm that taking in account only mental illness does not allow the prediction of one of those horrific events (Columbia University Department of Psychiatry, 2022). But those research also shows that including more details such as their traumas and life background could increase the ability to actually predict these events, more factors from the individual need to be taken in consideration (Metzl et al., 2021). Therefore showing that including more factors into the equation might allow us to predict and prevent mass shootings.</p>

        <p>with the help of an online calculator (which is https://www.statskingdom.com/140MeanT2eq.html) I calculated the p values using a T test, the results are as follows:</p>

        <h2><p style = "text-align: center">Conclusion</p></h2>
        <p>We conducted 3 hypothesis/correlation testings to get to know more about our dataset and try to identify the different correlations between our attributes. The Pearson correlation done by my friend proved unsuccessful as all the values were quite low, and it showed very little to no correlation between the attributes. For further investigation, we then set the null hypothesis as “the number of mental illnesses and personal traumas a person suffers from does not affect their likelihood to commit mass shooting, and does not affect the number of people they are likely to kill”. The chi square done by my friend also failed to prove the correlation between the different attributes, as all the p values were lower than 0.05, we couldn't reject our null hypothesis. But the T test I conducted was an actual success, thus proving that there is an actual correlation. The 2 failures and 1 success showed that the relation between them does exist but is not as obvious as we thought it was. We think that tt might not only be based on the count itself but more on the present patterns among the different illnesses and traumas.</p>
